 
Hello, I am cipher387 (aka <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cyb_detective" title="My Twitter"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-@cyb_detective-1ca0f1?style=flat-square&labelColor=1ca0f1&logo=twitter&logoColor=white&link=https://twitter.com/cyb_detective"></a>). I am very passionate about OSINT (open-source intelligence) and everything related to it.

I follow a Twitter account where I post various practical notes about OSINT, with occasional distractions from other cybersecurity and tech-related topics.
