Hello, I am cipher387 (aka @ivan30394639). I am very passionate about OSINT (open-source intelligence) and everything related to it.

I follow a Twitter account where I post various practical notes about OSINT, with occasional distractions from other cybersecurity and tech-related topics.

I collect all useful and interesting links from my tweets on a separate site. There are already 371 tools there for various OSINT-related tasks

I am also slowly developing my own services for OSINT. I have huge plans and projects, but so far I put only the simplest projects in the public domain.
